TThe Baltimore Sun analyzed data on vacant buildings for an Oct. 18, 2019 story titled ["Baltimore is furiously knocking down vacant houses —  but can’t keep up as new ones go empty"](https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-ci-vacants-demolition-progress-20191018-mw3cb5vlbjb4dmnxlbjvjg7tdy-story.html).

The Sun's findings and analysis are available in the "analysis" markdown file in this repository: [`02_analysis.md`](xxxx). The data was cleaned nd pre-processed prior to analysis. For more information, see [`01_processing.md`](xxx).

If you'd like to run the code yourself in R, you can download the R Markdown files [`01_processing.Rmd`](xxxx) and [`02_analysis.Rmd`](xxxx) along with the data in the [`input`](xxx) folder.
